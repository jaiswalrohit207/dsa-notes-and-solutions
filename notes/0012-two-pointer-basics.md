# Problem 0012: Two Pointer Basics

## Problem Summary
Master two pointer technique for array problems.

## Key Concepts
- **Two Pointers**: Start from opposite ends
- **Convergence**: Pointers move towards each other
- **Efficiency**: Avoid nested loops

## Solution Approaches
1. **From Ends**: Start at opposite ends
2. **From Start**: Both pointers start from beginning, different speeds

## Time-Space Complexity
- **All Approaches**: O(n) time, O(1) space

## Interview Tips
- Explain when two pointers apply
- Why it's better than nested loops
- Show variants: convergent vs divergent
